# Gentleman WTF

A Dota 2 custom game for reliving the memories of DotA Allstars inhouse funrooms. Basically an All Random Deathmatch (-ardm) game in WTF mode (hero abilities have no cooldowns or mana costs), but with gentleman rules.

The Dota 2 scripting API is a largely unsupported mess that lacks many features and is poorly documented. To create a custom game, one must first install the optional DLC package for Dota 2 called **Dota 2 Workshop Tools DLC**. Creating an Addon using the Tools creates two folders, one at `dota 2 beta/content/dota_addons` and the other one at `dota 2 beta/game/dota_addons`, `dota 2 beta` being the Dota 2 installation folder. In this case, Gentleman WTF is stored as **wtf**, and the Addon data is found in the `content/dota_addons/wtf` and `game/dota_addons/wtf` folders.

# Gentleman WTF

A Dota 2 custom game for reliving the memories of DotA Allstars inhouse funrooms. Basically an All Random Deathmatch (-ardm) game in WTF mode (hero abilities have no cooldowns or mana costs), but with gentleman rules.

The Dota 2 scripting API is a largely unsupported mess that lacks many features, and there are no good tutorials for learning it. To create a custom game in Dota 2, one must install the optional DLC package for Dota 2 called **Dota 2 Workshop Tools DLC**. Creating an Addon using Workshop Tools creates two folders, one at *dota 2 beta/content/dota_addons*, and the other at *dota 2 beta/game/dota_addons*, where *dota 2 beta* is the Dota 2 installation folder. In this case, the name of *Gentleman WTF* is **wtf**, and the Addon data is found at *content/dota_addons/**wtf*** and *game/dota_addons/**wtf***.
